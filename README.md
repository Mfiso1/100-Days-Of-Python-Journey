# 100-Days-Of-Python-Journey
The Journey begins on the 20 July 2024 


# My Python Coding Journey
Welcome to my Python coding journey! This repository is a journal of my daily progress as I embark on a 100 days coding challenge. Each day, I'll be diving into different aspects of Python programming, from basics to advanced concepts, and documenting my experiences, challenges, and achievements.

## What to Expect
Daily Logs: Detailed entries for each day, outlining what I learned, code snippets, and reflections.
Code Examples: Practical examples and mini-projects that illustrate the concepts I'm exploring.
Challenges & Solutions: Problems I encountered and how I resolved them, providing insight into the learning process.
Resources: Links to tutorials, articles, and other resources that have been helpful along the way.

# Why This Journey?

The goal of this challenge is to:

1. Build Consistency: Develop a habit of coding every day.
2. Improve Skills: Enhance my Python programming skills through consistent practice and real-world applications.
3. Share Knowledge: Provide a resource for others who are learning Python and may benefit from my experiences.

*Join me on this exciting journey as I document each step, share my learnings, and grow as a Python developer.*
